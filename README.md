## Hiya, I'm Bethany! 🧚‍♀️

## More About Me

* I am a full-stack developer who has recently graduated from a coding bootcamp, and has been coding independently for a year. I am working on a few projects currently, and am starting my journey of learning Elixir. Currently reading: Introducing Elixir by Simon St. Laurent & J. David Eisenberg.
* My background is in hair styling/bridal design and salon ownership. I am a 30-something career-changer, and happy to be so! I am always striving to learn more, be creative, and find more ways to be as remote as possible. 
* I spend too much of my free time reading books and playing video games, always while drinking tea and sitting next to my dog, Satoru. 🐶 🎮 🍵
